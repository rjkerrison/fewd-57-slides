This is a website which houses many slideshows, hosted on GitHub Pages.
This is generated from a repository [_rjkerrison/jekyll-remark-site_][jekyll-remark-site]
which houses the basics for creating a website repository of presentations.
Fork it on GitHub.

The slideshows are generated by [**remark**][remark].
It's [**Jekyll**][jekyll], a site preprocessor, which keeps them in one website.

This website contains the following presentations:

{% for page in site.pages %}
{% if page.title != nil and page.layout == 'presentation' %}
- [{{page.title}}]({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}})
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
