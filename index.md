Welcome to {{ site.title }}.

All lessons are listed on [the lessons page][lessons].

## How it works

This is a website which houses many slideshows, hosted on GitHub Pages.

This website is generated from a repository [_rjkerrison/fewd-57-slides_][fewd-57-slides]
which houses the basics for creating a website repository of presentations.
Fork it on GitHub.

The slideshows are generated by [**remark**][remark].
It's [**Jekyll**][jekyll], a site preprocessor, which keeps them in one website.
