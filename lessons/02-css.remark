## CSS Basics

---

{% include asset-image.html alt="A chair" image_file="02-css/chair.jpg" %}

CSS is what makes sites look the way they do.

HTML could say "boat" but the CSS determines the style of the boat.
Similarly, "chair."

which covers many of the common CSS selectors and properties.

Keep referring back to this example as we learn CSS basics.
